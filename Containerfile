# Warning: If you want to place anything in "/etc" of the final image, you MUST
# place them in "./usr/etc" in your repo, so that they're written to "/usr/etc"
# on the final system. That is the proper directory for "system" configuration
# templates on immutable Fedora distros, whereas the normal "/etc" is ONLY meant
# for manual overrides and editing by the machine's admin AFTER installation!
# See issue #28 (https://github.com/ublue-os/startingpoint/issues/28).
